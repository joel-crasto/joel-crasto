I'm currently studying Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo, and I'm interested in software design, embedded systems, electrical design, and I work on a variety of projects and teams to continue to grow in my field! Learn more about me, my projects, and my experience on my website (getting it ready for September 2025).
