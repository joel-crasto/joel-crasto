<h1>Welcome to my GitHub!</h1>

I'm currently studying Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I'm currently interested in software design, embedded systems, electrical design, and I work on a variety of projects in all areas to continue to grow as a developer! Learn more about me, my projects, and my experience at https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~jcrasto (this page will be live in September 2025).
